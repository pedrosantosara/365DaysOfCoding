# First Project in Express

In this project, I received an introduction to Express and its capabilities in handling web requests. In the upcoming days, this project will be further developed and expanded by adding features such as the database and error handling, which will be posted as folders 03, 04, and possibly 05.

# Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express


> **To start a Node.js project (you need Node.js on your machine)**

```
npm init -y
```
>**To install Express in your project**
```
npm install express --save
```
> **Install Nodemon to automatically restart the application**
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```
> **Put this command in your package.json to make it easier to start nodemon**
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  }
```

> **To run using only nodemon** 

```
npm start
```

# What I learned in this project

- HTTP methods **(GET, POST, PUT, DELET)**
- Project structure with the folders **(Controllers, routes, utils and server.js at the root of the folder)**
- A bit about routes
- Middlewares
- express-asnyc-erros (to avoid unexpected errors with asynchronous functions)
- Query Parameters
- Using Nodemon
